My name is Alex, and I am a passionate software engineer with over 10 years of experience. I have worked as a freelancer, contractor, and full-time employee, gaining valuable insights into various aspects of the industry and adapting accordingly.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in numerous projects in domains such as data visualization, banking and internet payments, travel industries, eCommerce, video streaming, and game marketing. I approached each project with passion and dedication, striving to improve it to the best of my knowledge at the time.

I recently re-discovered my love towards open source ðŸ’– and made a commitment to devote the free time of my life to it for the rest of what is left for me.
