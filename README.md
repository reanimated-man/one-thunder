Our name is `â¨‰`, `Alex`, `Alexei`, `Alexander` and other `?` number of identities dear to my heart. I refer to myself as us, but you shouldn't be bothered with any of my brain's shenanigans; the usage of he/him which is closer to my appearance is **absolutely appropriate**.

I am an extremely passionate software engineer with over 10 years of experience. I have worked as a freelancer, contractor, and full-time employee, gaining valuable insights into various aspects of the industry and molding into the context and environment I was placed in accordingly. Formless, shapeless [like water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ).

Throughout my career, I have been involved in numerous projects in domains such as data visualization, travel industries, banking, internet payments and eCommerce. Last but not least - healthcare, game marketing and video streaming. I approached each project with passion and dedication, striving to improve it to the best of my knowledge at
 the time.

I recently re-discovered my love towards open source ðŸ’– and made a commitment to devote the free time of my life to it for the rest of what is left for me.
