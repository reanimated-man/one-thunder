Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex, and I am a passionate software engineer with over 10 years of experience. I have worked as a freelancer, contractor, and full-time employee, gaining valuable insights into various aspects of the industry and adapting accordingly.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in numerous projects in domains such as data visualization, banking and internet payments, travel industries, eCommerce, video streaming, and game marketing. I approached each project with passion and dedication, striving to improve it to the best of my knowledge at the time.

Being a geek and an introvert can be challenging, but I channel my love and care through my code and the way I interact with others on a daily basis.
