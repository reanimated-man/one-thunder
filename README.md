### Heyo! ðŸ’¬

My name is Alex, a mere JS/Node developer from Moldova ready for any interesting challenge.  
Boredom kills me, so if you want me dead, give me some UI related things (It's a joke btw). But srsly, I can do anything provided there is enough coin :moneybag:  

### Professional work :city_sunrise:

### Personal work âš¡

I really enjoy modern c++ and game development, so I am creating stuff for the sake of my soul  
Some of this work you can see below :point_down:
