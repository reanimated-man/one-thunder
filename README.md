### Heyo! ðŸ’¬

My name is Alex, a mere JS/Node developer from Moldova ready for any interesting challenge.  
Boredom kills me, so if you want me dead, give me some UI related things (It's a joke btw). But srsly, I can do anything provided there is enough coin :moneybag:  

### Professional work :city_sunrise:

* Orange  
* Crunchyroll  
* Endava  
* Freelance on various sites 

[Development stack](https://github.com/one-thunder/one-thunder/blob/master/DevelopmentStack.md)

### Personal work âš¡

I really enjoy modern c++ and game development, so I am creating stuff for the sake of my soul ;)

More to come in upcoming months.
