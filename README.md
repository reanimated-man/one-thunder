Our name is X, Alex, Alexei, Alexander and other two dear to my heart. I refer to myself as us, but you shouldn't be bothered with any of my brain's shenennigans, so the usage of he/him which is closer to my physical appearance should be obvious.

I am a passionate software engineer with over 10 years of experience. I have worked as a freelancer, contractor, and full-time employee, gaining valuable insights into various aspects of the industry and molding into based on the context and environment I was in accordingly. Formless, shapeless [like water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ).

Throughout my career, I have been involved in numerous projects in domains such as data visualization, banking and internet payments, travel industries, eCommerce, game marketing, video streaming - anime, k-drama, variety content and adult content. I approached each project with passion and dedication, striving to improve it to the best of my knowledge at the time.

I recently re-discovered my love towards open source ðŸ’– and made a commitment to devote the free time of my life to it for the rest of what is left for me.
